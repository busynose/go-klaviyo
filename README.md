# Go Klaviyo

This is the Golang Klaviyo SDK built for Monstercat's purposes. It only includes the functionality which we need, but
feel free to make a PR to include any extra functionality you need.

## Some Notes

Klaviyo's HTTP API is very messy and has multiple versions thus we have done our best to keep it simple and work around
it. Please read the source code to see examples of this.

## Testing

You will need to use environment variables to test everything. Please read klaviyo_test.go for a list of them.

## Contributing Notes

 * You must have tests.
 * Keep it simple.
